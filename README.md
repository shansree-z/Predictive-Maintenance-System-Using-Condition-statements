# Predictive-Maintenance-System-Using-Condition-statements
This project uses Sensor Data Logic to prevent catastrophic machine failures in manufacturing environments.
♦️The Big Problem
In factories, machines often run until they break. This Reactive Maintenance causes:
High Costs: Replacing a broken spindle is 10x more expensive than a drill bit.
Safety Risks: Uncontrolled mechanical failure can cause fires or injuries.
Downtime: A stopped assembly line can lose a company $5,000 per hour.
🔷 The Small Solution (If-Else Logic)
Instead of complex AI that requires massive computing power, we use an Automated Decision Engine. By applying physics-based thresholds to real-time data, we flag machines before they fail.
⚙️ Logic Features:
Tool Wear Alert: Stops the machine if the tool has been in use for > 240 minutes.
Thermal Protection: Monitors the "Heat Dissipation" delta between the process and ambient air.
Strain Guard: Detects high torque levels that indicate a motor is struggling.
