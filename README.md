Turning Sensor Data into Actionable Intelligence
📋 Executive Summary
This project implements a high-efficiency, logic-based decision system utilizing the AI4I 2020 Predictive Maintenance Dataset. It provides a lightweight framework to transition industrial operations from costly reactive models to cost-saving proactive maintenance strategies.
🔴 The Industrial Problem: Reactive Failure
Traditional "Run-to-Failure" protocols in global manufacturing create severe operational bottlenecks:
Economic Impact: Catastrophic component failure (e.g., a primary spindle) is 10x more expensive to rectify than routine tool replacement.
Operational Loss: Unscheduled downtime results in a median loss of $5,000 per hour in lost throughput.
Occupational Safety: Unmonitored mechanical stress escalates the risk of thermal incidents (fires), debris projection, and operator injury.
🟢 The Technical Solution: Logic-Driven Automation
While complex Deep Learning models have their place, many industrial failures can be prevented with a High-Efficiency Decision Engine. This project utilizes optimized if-else branching logic to monitor physics-based thresholds in real-time sensor streams.
